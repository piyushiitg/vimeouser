Objective: to pull information from Vimeo users and provide a basic front-end to search various attributes of those users.

1. The site www.vimeo.com has approximately 15.8M users. You will write a script that crawls Vimeo to store the following information on 5,000 of these users in MySQL.

-	Name
-	URL of their vimeo user page
-	Whether they are a paying user (yes/no)
-	Whether they have one or more videos that are a “Vimeo Staff Pick” (yes/no)
-	Whether they have one or more videos they have uploaded to Vimeo (yes/no)

Here are two examples to illustrate:

Name: Cristóbal Vila
URL: http://vimeo.com/eterea
Paying: Yes (hint: see the blue “PLUS” badge that is located next  to their name)
Staff Pick: Yes (hint: http://vimeo.com/57125220) 
Video: Yes

Name: Luis García-Ochoa
URL: http://vimeo.com/luisg8a
Paying: No
Staff Pick: No
Video: Yes

2. Create a one-page basic front-end using django to allow:

-	Search for a Vimeo user (within the 5,000 users in your database).
-	Show the number of search results
-	You do not need to paginate. You can limit the search to 100 results (though the search number should still show total, even if greater than 100.)
-	Able to filter the search results by the following three items:
1.	Whether they are a paying user.
2.	Whether they have a Vimeo Staff Pick.
3.	Whether they have a video upload.

Please see the image on the next page as a reference. 

All searches and filters must be done through AJAX. There should never be a full page re-load after the user types in the url.
